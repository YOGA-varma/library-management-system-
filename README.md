It's great for beginners looking to understand dynamic UI transitions, form handling, and SPA-style design using plain JavaScript.

 Future Scope
Backend integration (e.g., with Firebase or Node.js).

Persistent book storage and user sessions.

Admin/user role-based authentication.

Enhanced UI with animations and book cover previews.
